        <h1>Step 0 - Allowing Email to Send These Messages:</h1>
        <p>To prevent scams, email won't let you send emails automatically, we can get around this by making it semiautomatic instead</p>
        <p>This still requires some changes to be done. First go to <u><span>chrome://settings/handlers</span></u> (this couldn't be link due to chrome security)</p>
        <p>Find mail.google.com and check if its already set to default and that sites can ask to handle protocols is checked. If not do so for both.</p>
        <p><u><b>Make sure prior to use that you are signed into the CYC email account. For extra security it is recommended to choose a special background for the email as it will carry over to the temporary display. You can also try the test email button on the main page</b></u></p>
        <p>Before sending the bulk emails, you should try the Test Email button. If you enter your email it doesn't open a new tab with the email template, go to where the URL address is, click the informtion icon (the small i in a circle) and then enable Pop-Ups and Redirects.</p>
        
        <h1>Step 1 - Formatting the Template:</h1>
        <p>In order for the emailer to find and replace the necessary information, special marks need to be added to the template</p>
        <p>To do so add a dollar sign followed by the text in curly braces to indicate a fill in as seen below</p>
        <p>Also don't forget to put the email subject first with the following formatting</p>
        <br>
        <center>
            <div class="ui centered card" style="width: 600px;">
                <div>
                    <h1>ORIGINAL TEMPLATE</h1>
                    <p>Subject: Giftcards</p>
                    <p>Hello (PLACE),</p>
                    <p>We, as the CYC, were hoping to reach out regarding getting $(MONEY) giftcards for our raffle.</p>
                    <p>Thanks,</p>
                    <p>CYC</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </center>
        <br>
        <center>
            <div class="ui centered card" style="width: 600px;">
                <div>
                    <h1>FIXED TEMPLATE</h1>
                    <p>SUBJECT: Giftcards</p>
                    <p>Hello ${PLACE},</p>
                    <p>We, as the CYC, were hoping to reach out regarding getting $<abbr title="Note the double dollar signs because you are asking for money">${MONEY}</abbr> giftcards for our raffle.</p>
                    <p>Thanks,</p>
                    <p>CYC</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </center>
        
        <h1>Step 2 - Creating Formatted Spreadsheet:</h1>
        <p>For every fill in present in the spreadsheet, it is required to have a column dedicated for that fill in. The spreadsheet should be in Microsoft Excel (.xlsx) format which can be downloaded from Google Sheets</p>
        <p>Additionaly, there should be two extra columns - one for the email and one for if it has already been sent</p>
        <p>Using the previous template, you can see this example</p>
        <center>
            <div class="ui centered card" style="width: 600px;">
                <div>
                    <h1>Example</h1>
                    <img src="assets/images/example_spreadsheet.png" width="90%">
                    <br>
                    <p>The main things to note are:</p>
                    <p>1. The email and send columns are first</p>
                    <p>2. The information columns headers exactly match the format of the fill in spaces in the template</p>
                    <p>3. Some of the sent column have values. These rows will not be considered for emailing (Only KFC, Starbucks, and Pizza Hut will be emailed)</p>
                    <p>3a. <span><u><b>Note: The sent column doesn't need to have dates, anything can be put in the cell to omit it from being sent</b></u></span></p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </center>
        
        <h1>Step 3 - Sending the Emails:</h1>
        <p>Make sure you are signed into the account you want to send the emails from</p>
        <p>This program is specifically designed to look for the CYC email when attempting to send the email</p>
        <p>Finally, before attemping the bulk send it is very much recommended to try the Test Email button to flush out any problems.</p>
